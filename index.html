			    <span itemprop="description">This is pretty authentic. I've seen a few "Viet" recipes submitted here which use ingredients that don't belong but I don't fault them since they are probably not Viet. The only thing this is missing is a few spices which are commonly used in pho but it is all dependent on your taste. Typically cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and probably a few others I can't remember now are also used. I've made pho for years and have yet to come up with my perfect spice ratio. It makes a big difference :) Another reviewer mentioned that their pot came out too oily. There a few ways to remove it. You can increase your knucklebone to marrow bone ratio (more knuckle). Or you can get a very fine mesh strainer sold at most Asian grocery stores and when you skim the scum out it is also fine enough to remove oil or just use a spoon to remove. Another method is to let the pot cool, then put it in the refrigerator for a few hours. The oils will harden and it can then be removed before you warm up the pot again. The last thing is that you can probably get away with simmering for 3-4 hours but of course longer is better and you'll have to add more spices/salt to make up for it. He simmers for a super long time which is why he used less spices.</span>

			    <span itemprop="description">This recipe did not work out for me. I baked the soup bones and then simmered per the recipe. The bones were fresh but the smell and taste were not like I've had in a restaurant.</span>
